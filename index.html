        <h2>Raeanna Warren</h2>
        <p>I'm 19 years old and currently majoring in Computer Science. 
            I'm passionate about technology, especially Apple products. 
            My favorite color is purple, though I'm also fond of pastel shades of pink and blue.
            As a Scorpio, I tend to be curious and driven, which plays into my interest in web development, 
            where I enjoy the creativity and problem-solving involved in building and designing for the web. </p>
